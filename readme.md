## EPFL Course Repo for MICRO-401 Machine Learning Programming

> Supervised by [Prof. Aude Billard](https://people.epfl.ch/aude.billard)

### Overview

> More details on [EPFL coursebook MICRO-401](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/machine-learning-programming-MICRO-401)

#### Description

This is a practice-based course, where students program algorithms in machine learning and evaluate the performance of the algorithm thoroughly using real-world dataset.

#### Content

This programming class complements courses on machine learning given in the school. It offers students the possibility to understand some machine learning algorithms in depth by programming them and testing them rigorously. Students will be working in team of two. They will be offered a choice of methods to program. Programming can be done in matlab or C/C++. Proper evaluation of machine learning will be stressed out. Students will learn about various methods to evaluate machine learning methods (crossvalidation, grid search, F-measure, ROC curve, etc) and will be asked to put these in practice.
